## [Dark.fi](https://dark.fi/) (Hardcore peeps)

**Zkrunner**
* To accelerate Darkfi ZK script developer's iteration speed, Darkfi needed a tool to generate a ZK proof's public inputs based on input witnesses, and a way to quickly prove and verify with a Darkfi ZK circuit.
* I contributed the Python bindings ([1](https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi/pull/178),[2](https://github.com/darkrenaissance/darkfi/pull/179)) for Darkfi's SDK
  * With others' contributions, it led to [this demo on Twitter](https://twitter.com/parazyd/status/1690776743756402688).

**Halo2 hack**
* POC This is a proof of concept to take Etheruem Foundation's Privacy Exploration and Scaling Group's [work on their Halo2 fork](https://github.com/privacy-scaling-explorations/halo2/pull/168) to [apply to Darkfi's Halo2 fork](https://github.com/parazyd/halo2/pull/2).
* The purpose is to allow Darkfi ZK circuit developer to accept additional arguments at runtime to configure their circuit.
 
## Toys / maybe startups

**Emap, minimal name service**
* It is a name service that supports forward name resolution (going from name to resources) and backward name resolution (going from resources to name) **in less than 200 lines of code** in order to maximize auditability and security.
* A fork of [DappHub's Dmap](https://github.com/dapphub/dmap) which is optimized to be as minimal as possible in implementation.

## Clojure backend dev

It's great. You should try it.
