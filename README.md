* Themes I believe to be under-explored in blockchain contracts:
  * Security by simplification through DSLs ([example from the STEPS](https://tinlizzie.org/VPRIPapers/tr2012001_steps.pdf))
  * Security by isolation ([example from QubesOS](https://t.co/DuWNrTnv76))
 * I am currently working in private audits, contests and bounties, with the goal of turning learning into tools that make contracts more secure. DM's open
