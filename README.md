Hello there, thanks for visiting my page!

I go by Exponential on the internet.

I am figuring out how to help savers to build a diversified portfolio with synthetic assets, with the end goal being saving on Ethereum being more secure than saving in a bank.
So success is when the populace considers self-custodying eg. commodities/fiats to be safer than using local banking infrastructure.
This matters and can make a good business, especially in places with weak banking infrastructure.

To this end:
1. design and implementation have to be simple to be secure
2. there needs to be long tail of assets, to support portfolio diversification for synth holders and stakers

So I am working on:
1. Bone, a simple non-custodial gold synethtic backed by 200% DAI reserve in value.
    1. Try it out on Rinkeby at https://exp7l.github.io/bone/ and read the source at https://github.com/exp7l/bone/blob/main/src 
2. Resilience, a Sythetix V3 implementation, with simplicity as a goal while supporting synth stakers and holders to construct a diversified portfolio
    1. Read the source at https://github.com/exp7l/resilience/tree/main/src
    2. Read the well-written proposal by Synthetix at https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-300/
    3. I am always looking for contribution, it's great way to learn : )
